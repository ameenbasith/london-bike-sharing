end to end data analysis project utilzing the london bike sharing dataset from kaggle

## Great News!

I have officially built my first data analytics project (all due to the help of Mo Chen!)

I learned a ton of hands-on knowledge regarding Pandas, Kaggle, and Tableau. That being said, there is a clear lack of understanding when it comes to tableau. Obviously, I'm just starting out here, but somehow, even though I followed the tutorial pretty closely, I messed up the heatmap.

BUT THIS IS OKAY! I am just starting out here, and I should have some strong analytical skills in no time!
